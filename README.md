# Motion/Distance Sensing Security System Project
This is my Final Project for CS 120B

## Dependencies
To replicate this project a few things are needed:
- Breadboard
- Wires
- Atmega 1284 Microcontroller
- Atmel Studio (to program Microcontroller)
- 2 LEDS
- 6 Resistors
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Potentiometer
- Seven Segment Display
- 16x2 LED Display

## Demonstration
[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2jINfxexFo) where I demonstrate how the project works using an Atmega 1284 Microcontroller.
This video also shows how the breadboard should look after everything is hooked up.
